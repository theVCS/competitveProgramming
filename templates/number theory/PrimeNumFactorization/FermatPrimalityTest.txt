// based on Fermat Little Test which states: 
//1. Fermat's little theorem states, that for a prime number p and a coprime integer a the following equation holds:              a^(p−1) ≡ 1 mod p where  2 <= a <= p - 2
//In general this theorem doesn't hold for composite numbers.

// if p is composite and for some a Fermat's little theorem holds then a is known as fermat liar and P in this case is known as Fermat pseudoprime

// carmichael number: there are some numbers example (561 = 3 * 11 * 17) which are composite but for each a Such that gcd(a,p) = 1, fermat little theorem holds.
