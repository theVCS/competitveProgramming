Main applications of trees include: 
1. Manipulate hierarchical data. 
2. Make information easy to search (see tree traversal). 
3. Manipulate sorted lists of data. 
4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects. 
5. Router algorithms 
6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess). 


1) The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2l. 
2) The Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is (2^h) – 1. 
3) In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is? Log2(N+1)    
4) A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least | Log2L |+ 1   levels 
In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.



Types:

Full Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children. The following are the examples of a full binary tree. We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaf nodes have two children. 

Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible 

Perfect Binary Tree: A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
