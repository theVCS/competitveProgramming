Properties::

1. The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^l.
2. The Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2^h – 1.
3. In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is? Log2(N+1) 
4. A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least | Log2L? |+ 1   levels 
5. In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.
6. Handshaking lemma is about undirected graph. In every finite undirected graph, an even number of vertices will always have odd degree The handshaking lemma is a consequence of the degree sum formula (also sometimes called the handshaking lemma). It implies that sum of degree of nodes is always even.


Types: 
Full Binary Tree A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children. The following are the examples of a full binary tree. We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaf nodes have two children.

Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible

Perfect Binary Tree A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
